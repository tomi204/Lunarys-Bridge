# ========================================
# Important Notes:
# ========================================
# 1. Your Ethereum wallet must be authorized on the NewRelayer contract
#    Contact the contract owner to call: authorizeNode(your_address)
#
# 2. Your Ethereum wallet needs enough ETH for:
#    - Bond amount (default 0.03 ETH, refunded after settlement)
#    - Gas fees for claiming transactions
#
# 3. Your Solana wallet needs SOL for:
#    - Transfer fees on Solana (~0.000005 SOL per transaction)
#    - Rent for token accounts (if transferring SPL tokens)
#
# 4. The node will automatically:
#    - Listen for BridgeInitiated events on NewRelayer
#    - Claim requests by posting a bond
#    - Decrypt FHE-encrypted Solana destinations
#    - Transfer tokens on Solana
#    - Submit verification to the relayer API
#
# 5. Security:
#    - Never share your private keys
#    - Use a dedicated wallet for the node
#    - Start with small amounts for testing
#    - Monitor your node logs regularly
