# Welcome to LUNARYS

**LUNARYS** is an encrypted cross-chain bridge between Solana and Ethereum, powered by [Arcium](https://www.arcium.com/) - the encrypted supercomputer. It enables secure and private asset transfers by computing on encrypted data without ever decrypting it.

## What is LUNARYS?

LUNARYS enables seamless asset transfers between Solana and Ethereum while maintaining complete privacy through:

- **Encrypted Cross-Chain Transfers**: Assets move between chains with end-to-end encryption
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Cryptographic verification without revealing transaction details
- **Arcium Integration**: [Arcium](https://www.arcium.com/) encrypted supercomputer enables computation on encrypted data without decryption
- **Dual-Chain Architecture**: Native support for both Solana and Ethereum ecosystems

## Key Features

- **Cross-Chain Privacy**: Encrypted transfers between Solana and Ethereum
- **Zero-Knowledge Security**: Mathematical guarantees of correctness without data exposure
- **High Performance**: Solana's speed combined with Ethereum's security model
- **Decentralized**: No central custodians or trusted intermediaries

## Getting Started

To start using LUNARYS bridge:

1. **Set up wallets** on both Solana and Ethereum networks
2. **Fund your accounts** with native tokens (SOL/ETH) and assets to bridge
3. **Install the LUNARYS SDK** for seamless integration
4. **Initiate cross-chain transfers** with privacy guarantees

## How It Works

LUNARYS bridge operates through a secure multi-step process:

1. **Lock Assets**: Assets are locked on the source chain (Solana or Ethereum)
2. **Generate Proofs**: Zero-knowledge proofs verify the transfer without revealing details
3. **Cross-Chain Communication**: Encrypted data is transmitted between chains
4. **Mint/Release**: Equivalent assets are minted or released on the destination chain

## Architecture Overview

LUNARYS consists of several key components:

- **Smart Contracts**: Anchor programs on Solana and Solidity contracts on Ethereum
- **Relayer Network**: Off-chain infrastructure managing cross-chain communication
- **Privacy Layer**: Arcium-powered zero-knowledge computations
- **Bridge Interfaces**: User-facing applications for cross-chain operations
